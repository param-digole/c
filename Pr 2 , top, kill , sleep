1. top: The top (table of processes) command shows a dynamic, real-time view of running 
processes and kernel-managed tasks in Linux. The command also provides a system information 
summary that shows resource utilization, including CPU and memory usage.
Syntax : top [option]





2.ps : ps (process status) command is used to display information about the current running 
processes on the system. 
Syntax : ps [options] 
    ps -f , -a , e


kill : kill command which is used to terminate processes manually.
Syntax : kill [signal]PID


4. wait: wait command waits for a process to finish and it returns the termination status.
Syntax: wait [process_id]
Eg : wait 1123


sleep: Used to execute commands after certain amount of time by sleeping for given seconds
Syntax: sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]
NUMBER represents the time duration for which the command should sleep.
SUFFIX can be used to specify the unit of time (s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, etc.)
Ex. sleep 30


6.nice: This command is used to start a new process with a specific priority, known as the "nice 
value." A higher nice value lowers the process's priority, while a lower (negative) nice value 
increases it. Processes with higher priority receive more CPU time.
How Can You Check a Running Process's Nice Value?
To check the nice value of a running process, you can make use of the "ps" command with the 
"-l" option. Open a terminal and execute the following command:
ps -l <process_id>
