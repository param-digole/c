1. df
disk free also known as `df`, which is a powerful utility that provides valuable information on 
disk space utilization. The df command displays information about file system disk space usage 
on the mounted file system. This command retrieves the information from `/proc/mounts` or 
`/etc/mtab`. By default, df command shows disk space in Kilobytes (KB) and uses the SI unit 
suffixes (e.g, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes) for clarity.
Syntax:
df [options] [filesystems]

3. Vmstat
vmstat command is used to display virtual memory statistics of the system. This command 
reports data about the memory, paging, disk, and CPU activities, etc. The first use of this 
command returns the data averages since the last reboot. Further users return the data based on 
sampling periods of long delays.
Syntax : Vmstat

/proc/meminfo This file contains all the data about the memory usage. It provides the current 
memory usage details rather than old, stored values.
Syntax:

allows to scroll vertically and horizontally to allows users to view all processes running on the
